## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned the use of variable css class for efficiently handling color and font throughout the project.

- The need of setting up all required class (root section) before starting a project and using data attributes for styling different elements efficiently. 

### Useful resources

- [My only resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqFAs5d3Yl8) - This is a comprehensive video guide by Kevin Powell. I learned how to properly approach a project firsthand and will continue using it in future challenges and projects. I recommend to watch his videos for great insight in CSS.
